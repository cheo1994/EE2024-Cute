EE2024: Programming for Computer Interfaces

CUTE: Care Unit for The Elderly

Project was done on a LPCXpresso Base Board along with the LPC1769. 

### Project objective 
Expose students to programming for embedded devices.

### Description: In this project, we were exposed to programming several push buttons, light sensors, a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, UART and a LED display. 

| Component          | Requirement								     |
| -------------------|:---------------------------------------------:|	
| Light sensor       | Detect low light environment below 50 lux     |
| Temperature sensor | Detect temperatures above 35 degrees celcius  |
| UART               | Send an alert via UART terminal if temperature or light alarm reached|
