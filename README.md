CUTE: Care Unit for The Elderly

Project was done on a baseboard with LPC1769. 

The project makes use of several sensors such as light, temperature and the accelerometer. It reads the values and
displays it for the user to see. In the event the readings trigger any warnings, an alert would be sent via the UART
terminal to alert the care team about the elderly.
